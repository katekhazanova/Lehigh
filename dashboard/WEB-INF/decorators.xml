<!-- the url /sitemesh/* is mapped to the spring mvc sitemesh servlet. 
  this means that any requests that come to /sitemesh/* (and the only requests
  that come to that url will originate from the sitemesh filter and be for decorators) 
  will only be requests for decorators -->
<!-- explanation of what happens:
  suppose the url http://localhost/dcp/site/foo.html is requested
  * /dcp is the webapp context (it is ignored by sitemesh)
  * /site is the servlet mapping for the "site" servlet
  * /foo.html will load the foo.html template
  * sitemesh will apply the decorator named "site" to this request
  * the decorator that will be requested will be: /sitemesh/site.ftl
  * that decorator will be loaded from WEB-INF/freemarker/sitemesh/site.ftl
-->
