If you want to use the Banner Student Data Loader as is, simply place the banner-student-interfaces.jar file 
in the usr/lib directory of the u.achieve server installation.

If you plan to custom implement your Banner Student Data Loader, you can either build your own jar file and place
it in the usr/lib directory or place the class files directly in usr/lib, under their package specific structure.
