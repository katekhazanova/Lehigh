<h1>iPad Scrolling</h1>

<h2>Two Finger Scrolling</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Safari on the iPad scrolls using two finger scrolling for embedded content (like the PDF on the Audit page).</li>
	<li>It works just like one finger scrolling, but with two fingers next to each other</li>
</ul>

<h2>Easier Two Finger Scrolling</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If your iPad is having difficulty recognizing two finger scrolling, you may have to use it through the iPad's Accessibility options.</li>
	<li>Open Settings>General>Accessibility>Assistive Touch</li>
	<li>Set Assistive Touch to "ON"</li>
	<li>When on a webpage with embedded content, tap on the Assistive Touch icon on the bottom right of your screen.</li>
	<li>Select Device>More>Gestures>2</li>
	<li>You can now scroll embeded content with one finger scrolling as if you were using two finger scrolling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In SelfService, it is often the case that embedded content can be downloaded. After downloading, content can usually be scrolled using one finger scrolling</li>
	<li>Some other web browsers don't use two finger scrolling for embedded content. If it continues to be a problem for you, you might want to consider using a different browser.</li>
</ul>
